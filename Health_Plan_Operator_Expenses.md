# Health Plan Operator Expenses

## 1. Business Problem
**Context:** The directors of a health plan operator, which serves four regions of Brazil, have noticed that health insurance expenses have increased considerably and need to monitor the evolution of expenses. Directors asked a lot of questions and would like to be able to see the answers on a single screen or view. The available data correspond to the previous year of the operator's users.

**Data source:** Excel file with data collected from the company's system, with the following columns:
* Age: age of the health plan user
* Gender: gender of the health plan user
* BMI: User's Body Mass Index
* Child: children related to the user
* Smoker: user is a smoker or not
* Region: user region
* Health_Insurance_Value: health insurance value of each user

**Project goals:** Create a DASHBOARD that answers the following questions, in addition to other relevant analysis to the business:

  1. What is the operator's total expense?
  2. What is the average age of the operator's users?
  3. What is the average spend per region?
  4. Which age group has the highest expenditure on health insurance by region?
  5. Do children spend more than adults?
  6. What is the proportion of children per region?
  7. Does increasing age influence BMI?
  8. Who has more expenses, men or women?
  9. If the user is a woman, is the BMI above or below average?
  10. If you are a man, over 50 years old and from the Southeast region, is the expenditure higher or lower than the average expenditure in the region?

## 2. Data modeling
After loading the data into Power BI from excel format, transformations and modeling were carried out, as follows:
